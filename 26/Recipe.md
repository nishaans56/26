* **Step-by-step**
*For ease of understanding, I have divided this post in 3 main parts:

* Step 1 – Preparing the veggie balls
* Step 2 – Frying veggie balls

* **Lets start with step 1 – Preparing the Veggie Balls**

1. Take the finely chopped or grated veggies in a bowl. Here I added ½ cup finely chopped red cabbage, ½ cup grated carrot, ¼ cup finely chopped capsicum (green bell pepper), ¼ cup finely chopped french beans, ¼ cup finely chopped spring onions (scallions).

Step 2 – Frying Veggie Balls

8. Heat oil for deep frying in a kadai or pan. Add a small piece of ball to the hot oil. If the balls does not stick or settle down at the bottom of the pan, but comes up steadily the oil is ready for frying these veg manchurian balls.

9. Gently place the balls in the hot oil. The oil has to be medium hot. Too much heat and the manchurian balls will be browned from top and uncooked from inside. Less hot oil will make the balls absorb too much of oil.

10. When cooked from one side, turn the balls with a slotted spoon.

Step 3 – Making Veg Manchurian Dry

15. Once the veggie balls are fried, then it is time to make the sauce. In another pan, heat about ½ tbsp of the same oil in which we fried the balls or toasted sesame oil. Add ½ tablespoon finely chopped garlic, ½ tablespoon finely chopped ginger & 1 or 2 green chilies, finely chopped.

21. Keep the flame on the lower side and sprinkle ¼ teaspoon corn starch (corn flour). Adding corn starch is optional. Adding corn starch gives a good glaze to the manchurian sauce.

23. Quickly add ¼ teaspoon black pepper and salt as required. Stir again. After adding corn starch the sauce will begin to thicken, so one has to be quick. Keep a check on the salt as the soy sauce, tomato ketchup and chilli sauce already have salt in them. So add less salt.
