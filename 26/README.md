Manchurian in the Indian lingo is a term for fried veggies or fried meat (fish or prawns or chicken) in this spicy-umami sauce.

You can also call the sauce as manchurian sauce. Manchurian and many other Indian Chinese recipes were an invention of the Chinese community living in Kolkata.

This Chinese style of cooking was largely adapted to suit the Indian palate and also to have more vegetarian options in the cuisine.

I love Indo Chinese food. So much was my love for making Chinese food at home that in my teens I would make three of my favorite Indo Chinese recipes often â€“ Chilli Paneer, Corn Soup and Vegetable Manchurian.

The manchurian recipe presented here is a tried and tested recipe, like all my recipes. the result was a yummy veg manchurian that was excellent with plain steamed rice.
